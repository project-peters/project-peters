Welcome to project-peters! This is my GitHub portfolio where I will be uploading some personal projects coded in Python. 

I'm interested in leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques to automate and optimize data workflows. 

I'm also interested in applying AI prompt engineering to some previous and new data analysis projects in Python to enhance the efficiency and accuracy in my personal projects' outcomes!

My personal projects are based on things that I love or are very interesting to me. Everything here is still a work in progress - any input is appreciated!
